If you are using manual download and setup so keep all the files come with exe in one folder with exe. If any file missing except .configs.json this software will not run I recommend you to create shortcut of exe and put it on desktop to quick startup the software.

## Settings
You can customize **CPS**, **Debounce**, **click repeat** of both the tools by using settings option.

#### DEBOUNCE IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO CPS.

- **Debounce** : Delay between two clicks.
- **Click Repeat** : Number of clicks trigger at once.
- **CPS (click per second)** : Automatically calculated by program by using CPS formula.

After doing changes click save settings or close settings window to do not save settings.

## CPS Formula
`CPS = 999/(P*debounce_in_ms)+1`
where **P** is _power pizza's constant_ ðŸ˜… having value **1.3**

## Files
**.configs.json** : This file automatically creates whenever this software starts and this file stores all the settings like window transparency, debounce etc.

## Window Transparency
To hide the HEX Software window you can right-click the window and to make it appear again left-click the window.

MAX transparency and MIN transparency can be changed from **.configs.json** its value range from 0 to 1 decimal value.

## NOTE
- Every setting of **.configs.json** file can not be changed from software's settings button. I will make **.configs.json** fully customizable from settings button in feature for now only some options of **.configs.json** are available in settings button.
- Only one tool will be running at a time.
- CPS formula is not 100% accurate it gives approx value of CPS.
